## About Me

I am a backend engineer who enjoys understanding how systems work and how to make them better. Over the years, I’ve been involved in platform work, developer experience and backend feature development (mostly using Java, Kubernetes and CI/CD tooling).

In recent projects, I have helped improve deployment workflows using Tekton and ArgoCD, documented and supported teams through a platform migration and introduced a more transparent way to track technical decisions with Architectural Decision Records. I also built a CLI tool in Go to simplify developer onboarding.

I usually approach engineering with curiosity and a focus on clarity. I often ask “Could this be simpler?”. Not to challenge decisions, but to reduce friction for the team and improve long-term maintainability. I work well in distributed teams, enjoy async collaboration and value documentation as a shared resource.

Outside of work, I remain curious. I often explore new ideas or technologies after hours by experimenting with backend tools or reading about system design. I also enjoy learning outside tech. I spend time reading about personal development and I have taken an interest in calligraphy for its calm and focus.

Thanks for stopping by! 🙂
