In [*Tiny Experiments*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214268997-tiny-experiments), Anne-Laure Le Cunff talks about learning through small, low-stakes trials. Try something, reflect, adjust and repeat. It is a mindset that resonates with me, especially as an engineer.

We are surrounded by noise and fast-moving expectations. But in the middle of it all, we rarely make space to think about *how* we think. That’s where metacognition comes in. It is the simple but powerful act of stepping back and reflecting on what we are learning, doing and deciding.

Writing is one way I do that.

This blog is not about presenting polished ideas or definitive answers. It is a space for *tiny experiments*. For me writing is a tool to clarify my own thinking. When I sit down to explain something in words, I notice the parts I assumed I understood but didn’t. I slow down. I think more clearly.

Sharing what you learn might help someone else but even more importantly, it helps *you*. It is not about being an expert. It is about paying attention.

This blog is my space for tiny experiments. No polished essays, no definitive answers. It is just a way to make space for reflection, learning and the joy of figuring things out.

Thanks for stopping by!
