As a backend engineer working in infrastructure and developer experience, I wanted a place where I could share what I’m learning, highlight my projects, and help recruiters and engineers get a sense of who I am. So, I built this site — hosted entirely on GitHub Pages using Jekyll.

## 🎯 Why I built a portfolio

After almost a decade in the industry, I realized my GitHub profile and LinkedIn alone don’t tell the whole story. I wanted:

- A space to write about what I’m learning
- A home for side projects like RouteSandbox or Loan Buddy
- A clean, professional site to link in job applications

## 🧱 Tools and stack

I went with:

- **GitHub Pages**: Free and easy hosting
- **Jekyll**: A static site generator that works out of the box with GitHub Pages
- **StartBootstrap Clean Blog theme**: Elegant and minimal, with a structure suited for writing

## 🛠️ Steps I took

1. **Cloned the theme repo**  
   I started from [`startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll`](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll), which gave me a working structure with posts, pages, and SCSS support.

2. **Customized the config**  
   I updated `_config.yml` with my name, GitHub handle, and site description. This file is the brain of a Jekyll site.

3. **Set up GitHub Pages**  
   I pushed the project to `cristina-sirbu.github.io`, enabled Pages in the repo settings, and the site was live in minutes.

4. **Tweaked the design**  
   I changed the background image, cleaned up some old Sass imports, and removed unnecessary components to keep it lightweight.

5. **Wrote this post** 😉  
   My posts live in `_posts/` and use Markdown. Writing and versioning content as code is a huge productivity boost.

## 🔍 What's next

I'll continue updating the site with:
- Blog posts about topics I work with: Kubernetes, Spring Boot, developer tooling, Go, Terraform
- Notes from interview prep
- Project pages for the systems I’m building
