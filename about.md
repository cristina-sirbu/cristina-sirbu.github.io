Hi, I'm **Cristina Junca** — a backend engineer with 9+ years of experience building reliable systems in cross-functional teams.

I enjoy working with infrastructure, developer experience, and clean backend code. I care about writing things down, helping others, and improving everyday workflows.

🛠 **Things I work with:**
- Java, Spring Boot, Maven
- Kubernetes, Docker, GitHub Actions
- Terraform, a bit of Go (learning by doing)
- CI/CD, alerting, internal tooling

🤝 **How I work:**
I like solving real problems, taking shared responsibility, and collaborating in a calm and honest way. I'm not a rockstar or ninja – just someone who tries to be helpful and dependable.

🎯 **What motivates me:**
I'm driven by meaningful work, supportive teams, and good communication. I enjoy learning from colleagues and taking initiative when something can be improved.

📌 I live in Stockholm and I'm looking for roles where I can contribute to backend systems, tooling, or infrastructure — ideally in a company that values focus, kindness, and transparency.
